# CubeSat-Lunex-GUI

## Overview

The CubeSat-Lunex-GUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed for conducting lunar scans using ground-based telescopes, rovers, and CubeSats. This project focuses on spectroscopy and imaging, enabling users to analyze the moon's surface and gather valuable scientific data.

## Features

- **Lunar Imaging**: Capture high-resolution images of the moon's surface.
- **Spectroscopy**: Analyze light spectra to identify minerals and elements present on the lunar surface.
- **Remote Control**: Interface with ground-based telescopes, rovers, and CubeSats for seamless operation.
- **Data Visualization**: View and manipulate captured images and spectral data in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CubeSat-Lunex-GUI.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CubeSat-Lunex-GUI
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the GUI:
   ```bash
   python moon_scanner_GUI.py
   ```

2. Connect to your telescope, rover, or CubeSat through the interface.

3. Select the desired mode (imaging or spectroscopy) and initiate the scan.

4. Analyze the collected data using the built-in visualization tools.
